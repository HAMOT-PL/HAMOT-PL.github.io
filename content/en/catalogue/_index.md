developing technologies that enable us to create innovative products made 100%
from recycled materials. Every product we make proves that excellent quality,
durability, and environmental care can form a single, cohesive whole.

As long-standing players in the field of recycling, we supply the highest
quality semi-products, which form a solid foundation for manufacturers. Our
technologically advanced granulate and pure regrind are the result of processes
refined over 30 years, guaranteeing stable parameters and consistency in every
batch. We provide a reliable raw material that optimizes production processes
and allows for the creation of end products – such as PVC window profiles – of
uncompromising quality.
